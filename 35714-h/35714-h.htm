<h2><span>HOW SHE FELT IN HER FIRST CORSET.</span></h2>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>It occurred at Belgrade, where the genial Tom Quaw,</div>
<div>Gave a party, the first that the town ever saw;</div>
<div>The youth and the beauty, the tillers of soil,</div>
<div>Attended that night, seeking surcease from toil.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>There were farmers whose hair had a tinge of the gray;</div>
<div>There were maidens than whom none were ever more gay;</div>
<div>There were youths who could ride anything that wears hair,</div>
<div>And matrons whose faces showed lines of dull care.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Of the ladies who on this occasion took part,</div>
<div>Some were dressed in the nobbiest style of the art;</div>
<div>And the others, unmindful of fashion's decrees,</div>
<div>Were attired to have much more comfort and ease.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><div>There was one blushing damsel, just budding sixteen,</div>
<div>Whose waist by a corset ne'er encircled had been,</div>
<div>But whose mother insisted that on such a night</div>
<div>One should find a place there, and the lacing be tight.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>So the girl was rigged out as the mother desired,</div>
<div>But of dancing 'twas noticed the damsel soon tired.</div>
<div>"What's the matter?" was asked by some one at her side.</div>
<div>"I feel just like bucking," the maiden replied.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="i2">Sweetheart of mine,</div>
<div class="i2">A valentine,</div>
<div>In duty bound, I send thee,</div>

<div>May evermore attend thee.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Near, or apart,</div>

<div>'Gainst countless foes I'd wrestle.</div>

<div class="i2">Since I am thine,</div>
<div class="i2">Pray do be mine,</div>
<div>My heart prompts me to ask thee;</div>

<div>I own have quite possessed me.</div>

<h2><span>TO THOSE WHO HOLD THE GUIDING REINS.</span></h2>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>I have observed a steed, proud-spirited,</div>
<div>Lashed by a cruel driver till the sweat</div>
<div>Stood out in beaded drops upon his side;</div>
<div>And, oftimes, tears have welled up in my eyes</div>
<div>As in my mind I've pictured human hearts</div>
<div>Lashed thus by cruel words and goaded on.</div>
<div>Then when, at other times, the same proud steed</div>
<div>Has passed along the street with arched neck,</div>
<div>With every motion breathing force and vim,</div>
<div>I've noticed kindness held the guiding reins</div>
<div>And kept in check the zealous prancer's power.</div>
<div>My mind has pictured then, with kindlier glow,</div>
<div>A heart ambitious, far too keen to go,</div>
<div>Kept by sweet loving words in proper bounds;</div>
<div>And deepest gratitude, at such a time,</div>
<div>Wells up for those who hold the guiding reins.</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>"His face is his fortune;"</div>
<div class="i2">Yes, seldom we see</div>
<div>One for "tick" importune,</div>
<div class="i2">As boldly as he.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Like one who has riches</div>
<div class="i2">Acquired by gift,</div>
<div>He laughs at the stitches</div>
<div class="i2">Of gainer by thrift,</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>For face is his treasure,</div>
<div class="i2">And why keep in bank?</div>
<div>One cannot find pleasure</div>
<div class="i2">With pocket-book lank.</div>

<div>So credit he uses</div>
<div class="i2">Where'er it will pass,</div>
<div>And always abuses</div>
<div class="i2">The laboring class.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><div>But "cheek" is like iron</div>

<h2><span>A LOVE LETTER AND ITS ANSWER.</span></h2>

<p class="bold">A MONTANIAN TO HIS SWEETHEART.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Darling, I love thee! Other words might tell</div>
<div>A trifle of how dear thou art to me,</div>
<div>But these tell all. Of thee I might have said,</div>
<div>And said in truth, at that, that all thy ways,</div>
<div>Thine every motion, look and glance, as well,</div>
<div>Did charm the inmost recess of my soul:</div>
<div>In words of praise, and those in justice due,</div>
<div>I might the beauties of thy mind portray;</div>
<div>For they outrival charms that in thy face</div>
<div>I see, as elsewhere I have failed to find:</div>
<div>Thy modesty, thy grace, thy love of all</div>
<div>That tends to elevate, to purify,</div>
<div>And make a fellow mortal happier,</div>
<div>I might have dwelt on to a length that thou,</div>
<div>And thou alone, deserves from one whose pen</div>
<div>Is feeble in thy praise as is mine own.</div>
<div>Still, had I done so, and withheld the words,</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><div>"I love thee!" I had never told thee half.</div>
<div>I love thee, darling! Ah! indeed, I do!</div>
<div>Beyond the shadow of a doubt, I love,</div>
<div>And such a one as any prince or king</div>
<div>Might gladly love and proudly call his own.</div>
<div>But, come to think, this love is all I have:</div>
<div>No titled rank is mine&mdash;no Astor's wealth;</div>
<div>And one you know, can't live on love alone;</div>
<div>Ah, no! But better starve for lack of bread</div>
<div>Than want of love; for when we starve for bread,</div>
<div>And hunger knaws with all its well-known force,</div>
<div>A day and all desire for food grows weak,</div>
<div>And in its stead one craves but rest and sleep:</div>
<div>These come, and few the days ere dreamless sleep</div>
<div>Supplies the place of all desires and pains.</div>
<div>But, starve for love, and when doth come relief?</div>
<div>The weary soul still lives, or drags along&mdash;</div>
<div>As pris'ner doomed for life goes to his work;</div>
<div>Ambitionless it moves, its purpose dead,</div>
<div>Yet ling'ring like 'twere powerless to go;</div>
<div>Struggling 'twixt hope and fear, as thro' the bars</div>
<div>A gleam of sunshine flitters now and then,</div>
<div>Glad'ning the while it shines, to leave more dark</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><div>The gloomy dungeon of an unloved life;</div>
<div>Moving, as moves the lifeless rock or ore</div>
<div>When those with life exert o'er it their power;</div>
<div>Living! Ah, yes! But devil never cursed</div>
<div>His vilest victim with a death so dread;</div>
<div>Standing, as stands an engine on the track,</div>
<div>Perfectly built in all its mighty parts,</div>
<div>Its boiler and its furnace amply fed,</div>
<div>Yet powerless. But, let the flame of love</div>
<div>Touch but one splinter of the waiting pyre,</div>
<div>And all is changed. In gladsome bounds the blaze</div>
<div>Leaps on and on, till burning with one flame,</div>
<div>The fire warms the slumb'ring soul to life;</div>
<div>Warms till, as love directs, its living proves&mdash;</div>
<div>When under wisdom's hands&mdash;man's highest bliss.</div>
<div>Yes, when love fills the heart, behold how strong,</div>
<div>How powerful one stands! His muscles ache</div>
<div>With pure strength, and long for that on which</div>
<div>Their latent power to show; and not alone</div>
<div>In idle longings doth a lover stand,</div>
<div>But works alike with both his head and hands</div>
<div>To gain desired ends. Doth one lack means?</div>
<div>Then love supplies a purpose and desire,</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><div>And rests not still till they are at command.</div>
<div>Doth one feel weak? Then love doth make him strong.</div>
<div>Is one a slave to appetite or care?</div>
<div>Then love doth free him from the galling chains.</div>
<div>Doth one lack knowledge or attainments rare?</div>
<div>Then love spurs on till all of these are gained.</div>
<div>Yes love, and that alone, is all I have;</div>
<div>But, darling, having that, I offer thee</div>
<div>More than all else another man can give,</div>
<div>Who hath abundance, and is rich in all</div>
<div>Save love, and that for thee, and thee alone.</div>
<div>This is my plea. I stand and wait my fate.</div>
<div>If thou dost love me, darling, tell me so;</div>
<div>If not&mdash;but that can never be, I know.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="bold">THE ANSWER SHE GAVE HIM.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Your note to me, of recent date,</div>
<div>Where you are so importunate,</div>
<div>Has been received, and I have read,</div>
<div>With greatest care, what you have said.</div>
<div>I am quite pleased that you can see</div>
<div>So much to praise in one like me,</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><div>And only wish that I could say</div>
<div>Nice things in such a pretty way.</div>
<div>But, tell me! do you really think</div>
<div>That love is better than "the chink?"</div>
<div>Why, money rules the world to-day,</div>
<div>With strong and unresistless sway!</div>
<div>'Tis little schoolboys talk of love.</div>
<div>But as they older grow, improve;</div>
<div>While girls, though they be very young,</div>
<div>Know better but may hold their tongue.</div>
<div>If you have money, then you can</div>
<div>Go where you will, and be a man;</div>
<div>But if you're poor&mdash;a genius, too&mdash;</div>
<div>Your family can be but blue,</div>
<div>While oft you'll wish for food to eat,</div>
<div>And for firm friends your heart to greet.</div>
<div>You own you're poor, yet ask of me</div>
<div>To share a poor man's misery!</div>
<div>Why men would be real scarce indeed,</div>
<div>Ere I should think to feel the need</div>
<div>Of one who nothing has but love!</div>
<div>Poor men abound where'er we rove,</div>
<div>And I can get one any day:</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><div>(When rich, pray call around this way).</div>
<div>Suppose we loved, and married were,</div>
<div>And fortune gave to us an heir,</div>
<div>Pray who would nurse and care for it?</div>
<div>Who train its mind? who mould its wit?</div>
<div>Who'd wash the dishes, cook the food,</div>
<div>Do out-door chores, and cut the wood?</div>
<div>What buggy rides would I receive?</div>
<div>How many friends would to me cleave?</div>
<div>And then there's concerts to attend,</div>
<div>And other places, that transcend</div>
<div>The theaters and balls that now</div>
<div>We with unstinted praise endow.</div>
<div>Oh, no! don't ask of me to wed</div>
<div>A loving fellow, though his head</div>
<div>Be better filled with brains than those</div>
<div>Who dress themselves in finer clothes:</div>
<div>I want a man who's rich in stocks&mdash;</div>
<div>(D'ye think I'd ever darn old socks?)</div>
<div>You talk of love and lovers bold,</div>
<div>As though I'd care if icy cold</div>
<div>Were heart of him to whom with pride</div>
<div>My loving heart I'd fondly tied.</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><div>I would be rich and nothing care,</div>
<div>For I'd have lover's everywhere;</div>
<div>And when of one I tired grew,</div>
<div>I'd take my pick and love anew.</div>
<div>Now don't be angry with me, pray,</div>
<div>For what I've written you to-day;</div>
<div>You were to me so frank and true</div>
<div>I could not well be less to you;</div>
<div>So I have said what all must feel,</div>
<div>Though some, I know, the facts conceal.</div>
<div>Then do not seek just now to wed,</div>
<div>But wait until you're rich, instead.</div>

<h2><span>THE BABY'S CLOTHES.</span></h2>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Let poets praise, as in days gone by,</div>
<div>The wealth of a loving maiden's sigh;</div>
<div>The bliss ecstatic of every bride,</div>
<div>And honeymoon pleasures that ne'er subside;</div>
<div>I sing of a happier time than those,</div>
<div>The time when making the baby's clothes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>A girlish heart may o'erflow with joy</div>
<div>When with the one she would call "her boy,"</div>

<div>But joys surpassing the sweetest of those</div>
<div>Come when preparing the baby's clothes.</div>

<div>I was a teacher then, as now,</div>
<div class="i2">And made a little spending money.</div>
<div>By training big and little sprouts,</div>
<div class="i2">In a mining town called Pony.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>One night the biggest boy I had,</div>
<div class="i2">For having cracked a rigid rule,</div>
<div>Was bade to stay and con his books</div>
<div class="i2">Some fifteen minutes after school.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>I for a moment turned my back&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">On other duties then intent&mdash;</div>
<div>The fellow slyly raised a sash</div>
<div class="i2">And through the opening quickly went.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div>Next eve, as extra punishment,</div>
<div class="i2">I gave him minutes forty-five;</div>
<div>And, lest he play the prank again,</div>
<div class="i2">I kept my every sense alive.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><div>The task performed, he left the room;&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">The sun was shining then, no more,&mdash;</div>
<div>And when, soon afterwards, I left,</div>

<h2><span>TRUE LOVE.</span></h2>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div>Ask of the winds, that all around</div>
<div class="i2">In saddest requiem blow,</div>
<div>Wherein, and where alone, is found</div>
<div class="i2">True happiness below;</div>
<div>And when "in love" their answer is,</div>
<div class="i2">Would you love's secret know?</div>
<div>Consider both have equal rights,</div>

<div>Thus sang a poet months ago,</div>

<div>A home where, years before, the bride</div>

<div class="i2">A bud of misery.</div>

<div class="i2">Yes, thinking it a rose,</div>

<div class="i2">No fragrance did enclose:</div>
<div>But so the after years have shown,</div>
<div class="i2">And blighted hearts are found</div>
<div>Where once affection reigned supreme,</div>
<div class="i2">And spread its joys around.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div>A youth, not handsome from an outward view,</div>
<div>Whose features stern belied the mellowness</div>
<div>That dwelt behind his earnest, steadfast look,</div>
<div>Delved in his heart upon a summer day</div>
<div>And found therein a narrow vein of love.</div>
<div>The prospect pleased, and on development</div>
<div>He found the mine was rich. For years he worked</div>
<div>And piled in heaps the ore upon the dump.</div>
<div>Deep 'neath the mountain ridges of his heart</div>
<div>He branched out levels on the silvered streak,</div>
<div>And found almost exhaustless hidden wealth.</div>
<div>He sought association, and he found</div>
<div>A friend who brought the skill to treat the ore.</div>
<div>He wasted not the wealth by labor won,</div>
<div>But, when refined, he stored the bricks away,</div>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><div>Until within himself there was no space,</div>

<div>A distant shore, and one to coin his wealth.</div>
<div>Undauntedly, despite unbroken paths,</div>
<div>Unheeding storms and floods, he presses on</div>
<div>To reach her side. An aged man stands guard,</div>
<div>And yet he marches up the walks unchecked.</div>
<div>His very boldness awes. A maiden there</div>
<div>Is pleased with what he brings, and from her heart</div>
<div>She gladly pays him golden coin therefor.</div>
<div>She mints her boughten wealth, and later on</div>
<div>They meet again. They ride the garden gate.</div>

<div>The years roll by and for the staff of life</div>
<div>They live on love. They need conveniences,</div>
<div>And love provides them all. Their luxuries</div>
<div>Are daily feasts of love. There are some days</div>
<div>When, overcome by care and household toils,</div>
<div>Her heart is faint, but when she seeks his side</div>
<div>She meets love's sweet caress and cheering kiss,</div>
<div>And wonders that her spirits ever drooped.</div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
